Reward Structure obtained with 200 runs of simulation with these parameters: 

 nTrials=200; % total number of trials
 nSwitches=5; % number of (step) changes in the outcome probabilities
 blockSize=nTrials/nSwitches; % number of trials between switches in the outcome probabilities
 % Define multinomial probability parameters for the better (row 1) and
 % worse (row 2) bandits.
 pOutcomes=[0.25 0.15 0.60; 0.60 0.15 0.25];
 pWindow=40; % Number of trials within which the *frequency* of outcomes matches the nominal probabilities

Best performance was reached with: 

bestAlpha = 0.5263
bestTau = 0.2195
